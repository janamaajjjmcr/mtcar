## 🔍 Comprehensive Interpretation of Results

### 🔄 Relationship Between MPG and QSEC
The graph illustrates a **positive relationship** between quarter-mile time (`qsec`) and miles per gallon (`mpg`).  
As `mpg` increases — indicating **better fuel efficiency** — `qsec` also increases, meaning **slower acceleration**.  
This reflects a fundamental automotive engineering trade-off between **fuel efficiency** and **performance**.

### ⚙️ Analysis by Cylinder Groups

#### 🔵 4-Cylinder Cars
- Located predominantly in the **upper-right** portion of the graph  
- **Highest mpg** values → excellent fuel efficiency  
- **Higher qsec** values → slower acceleration  
- Ideal for **economical daily driving**  
- Prioritize **fuel economy** over performance  

#### 🟢 6-Cylinder Cars
- Positioned in the **middle** of the graph  
- **Moderate** mpg and qsec values  
- Represent a **balanced trade-off** between performance and efficiency  
- Offer **acceptable acceleration** and **reasonable fuel consumption**  
- Suitable for users seeking **versatility**  

#### 🔴 8-Cylinder Cars
- Clustered in the **bottom-left** region of the graph  
- **Lowest qsec** values → fastest acceleration  
- **Lowest mpg** values → poor fuel economy  
- Built for **performance-oriented driving**  
- Prioritize **power and speed** over fuel efficiency

### 📊 Engineering Implications
This visualization clearly demonstrates how **engine configuration** (i.e., cylinder count) influences both fuel economy and acceleration:

- **Higher cylinder count → Lower mpg + Lower qsec** (more power, less efficiency)  
- **Lower cylinder count → Higher mpg + Higher qsec** (more efficient, slower)

This trend makes it possible to **predict cylinder count** based on a vehicle’s mpg and qsec values:
- **High mpg + high qsec** → likely a 4-cylinder car  
- **Low mpg + low qsec** → likely an 8-cylinder car

### ✅ Practical Applications
This analysis provides valuable insights for:

1. **Consumers** selecting vehicles based on their needs (fuel efficiency vs. performance)  
2. **Manufacturers** designing vehicles for different market segments  
3. **Engineers** making informed trade-offs between power and efficiency  

The visualization confirms expected engineering patterns and highlights how **cylinder count is a key differentiator** in automotive design.



## 1-	Read the file using R programming language.

## 4-	Plot the values of the columns mpg and qsec into an x&y graph.
## 5-	Plot painted values of “cyl” on the same graph.
